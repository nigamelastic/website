I realized my potential for breaking things right from childhood (pun intended). Ever since I hacked my RAM and Reverse Engineered a game to work on my low end PC at the age of 13, I knew, this is where my career lies. This led me to choose a 4-year engineering course in computer science as a bachelor's degree. Now, I am a Technology Enthusiast with 11 years of professional experience. I am currently living in Vienna (Austria), learning German, enjoying the city and working for Tricentis as Senior Product Security Engineer.
