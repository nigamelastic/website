## Description
**Room:** Daily Bugle
**Platform:** TryHackMe
**Difficulty:** Hard

## Enumeration

We start with Nmap.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.x.x
```

### Joomla Exploit
The web server is running Joomla 3.7.0, which is vulnerable to SQL Injection (CVE-2017-8917).

Using `sqlmap` or a python script, we can extract the password hash for the `jonah` user.

## Exploitation

### Cracking the Hash
We crack the hash using John the Ripper.

```bash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

### RCE via Reverse Shell
Logging in as `jonah`, we edit the template to include a PHP reverse shell.

## Privilege Escalation

### User: jjonah
We find credentials in `configuration.php`.

### Root
The user can run `yum` as root. We can use GTFOBins to escalate.

```bash
sudo yum update
# Spawns a shell
!/bin/sh
```
