## Summary

ProjectDiscovery's **Nuclei** has introduced a game-changing AI feature that allows for automatic template generation. This significantly streamlines the workflow for bug bounty hunters and security engineers by reducing the manual effort required to write YAML templates for new vulnerabilities.

We demonstrate:
- How to access the AI feature.
- Generating templates from vulnerability descriptions.
- Testing the generated templates against targets.
