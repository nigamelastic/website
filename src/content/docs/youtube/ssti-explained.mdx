## Summary

**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** is a critical vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). In this video, we break down the mechanics of SSTI, how template engines process input, and how to identify and exploit these flaws safely.

We cover:
- What is SSTI?
- Identifying template engines (Jinja2, Twig, etc.).
- Constructing payloads.
- Mitigation strategies for developers.
